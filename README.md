# Octofex
FV-1 Eurorack Module

The goal for this project was to create an FV-1 based Eurorack digital effects module to be used for live performance. 

The result is the Octofex, a 10HP module with full CV control of the 3 program parameters, plus manual clock speed and blend controls.

The Octofex is largely based on the Traouiero module, designed by Benjamin Bonnal, that is a 20HP stereo module. I opted for a mono module which helped
to reduce the circuit's size, further refinement of the design, splitting out the CV conditioning to separate dual op amps, as opposed to 2 quads for example,
allowed me to fit as much functionality as possible into the module.
