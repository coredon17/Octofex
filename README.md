# Octofex
FV-1 Eurorack Module

This ia a project that I developed with the help of JLCPCB. The complete details can be found here:

The result is the Octofex, a 10HP module with full CV control of the 3 program parameters, plus manual clock speed and blend controls.

The Octofex is largely based on the Traouiero module, designed by Benjamin Bonnal, that is a 20HP stereo module. I opted for a mono module which helped
to reduce the circuit's size, further refinement of the design, splitting out the CV conditioning to separate dual op amps etc. allowed me to fit as much
functionality as possible into the module.

The PCB and panel designs have been verified.
